 \hline
 Work Completion & We will all come to an agreement prior to beginning any work on each component of the project. Will will discuss times to collaborate together. We will complete work before the deadline.  \\ 
 \hline
 Work Quality & After agreeing specification for each component, the work should achieve each specification. If it doesn't, then we will all agree that a certain specification will not be met and why. We will discuss various elements of coding standards to maintain uniformity across our project.  \\ 
 \hline
 Meeting Attendance & All members must attend every meeting, unless they let us know that they will be unable to attend. Since our group is relatively small, we will consider rescheduling meetings if a time conflict arises. We will announce meetings before they take place, and make sure that everyone agrees on a particular time. We will communicate primarily on slack, and discord for remote work. \\ 
 \hline
 Meeting Preparation & Any work that must be completed prior to a meeting will to be completed before the meeting. If not, the group member responsible must notify the rest of the group with as much notice as possible so we can discuss rescheduling or continuing the meeting. \\ 
 \hline
 Conflict Management & Minor conflicts should first be attempted to be resolved between the involved members. If this isn't possible, it should be moderated by any uninvolved members. If this doesn't resolve the conflict, we can raise concerns with TA's.  \\ 
 \hline
 Code Reviews & Before any pull request is accepted, it must be reviewed by at least one other team member. For major code contributions, both team members should review the code. Major pull requests should be tested extensively before being accepted. Reviewers should attempt to run the code on their own machine as part of the reviewing process for any non-trivial changes. \\
